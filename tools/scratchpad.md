### Tags

#### Item Tags

* `liteminer:excluded_tools` - items in this tag can't be used for litemining (applies to main hand slot)
* `liteminer:included_tools` - if `require_tool` is true in server config, by default only "tool" items can be used (tiered items with durability); this can be used to allow extra items

#### Block Tags

* `liteminer:excluded_blocks` - blocks in this tag may never be litemined
* `liteminer:block_whitelist` - if this tag is non-empty, then _only_ blocks in this tag may be litemined

> Note: these tags are compatible with the FTB Ultimine tags, so you can use the same tags for both mods if you already have a setup you like.
