- **Blazing Edge** :fire:: Use a sword or axe while on fire to add fire damage to melee attacks.  
- **Frosty Feet** :snowflake:: Spend time on snow or ice to prevent slipping and reduce fall damage on snowy surfaces.  
- **Creeperbane** :boom:: Survive multiple creeper explosions with a shield to reduce shield damage from explosions.
