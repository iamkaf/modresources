**Bonded** is a gear-focused mod that encourages you to build a deeper connection with your tools and armor as you play.  

- **Level Up Your Gear**: The more you use your tools, weapons, and armor, the stronger they become, gaining bonus stats over time.  
- **New Stations**: Enhance and maintain your equipment using the new **Tool Bench** and **Repair Bench** introduced by the mod.  
- **Progression Through Play**: No complicated systemsâ€”just play the game and let your equipment grow alongside you.  

With **Bonded**, every item you craft becomes a companion on your journey.

The leveling and repairing feature will work with any tool and armor mod out of the box. Upgrade paths, however, will require compat mods that I can make at your request, just hmu.
