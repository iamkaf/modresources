Get ready for more than just music discs, this mod adds a whole new range of loot from Skeleton-assisted kills! 💎🎁\n\nIt’s like Minecraft meets golf... but with mobs, arrows, and lots of loot. Whether you're chasing rare blocks or just vibing with Creepers, *Extended Golf* takes your mob-slaying to the next level! ⛳💥\n\n\n### Features:\n- 🎯 **Every Mob Gets Its Own Loot**: No more generic drops, each mob has its own unique loot pool! From the Warden to Slimes, each kill brings new rewards.  \n- 🛠️ **Customizable Loot**: Want to change the loot? Create your own datapacks to swap out or add new drops. It's all in your hands!  \n- 💥 **Skeleton Assisted Kills**: Get those mobs in perfect range and let your Skeleton friend take a shot, it's all about positioning! ⛳️  \n- 🔄 **More Than Just Music Discs**: This isn’t your average skeleton kill, expect everything from rare materials to fun, quirky items!"
