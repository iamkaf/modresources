# Moddy ðŸ¤–

Moddy is a small Python helper script for the [multiloader-template](https://github.com/iamkaf/multiloader-template). It bundles the setup and maintenance tools used when starting a new mod project.

## Concept

Instead of a collection of individual scripts, Moddy distributes a single self updating file. This keeps the template lightweight while still allowing improvements to be delivered quickly.

## Problem it solves

Setting up a new mod normally requires renaming packages and updating identifiers in several modules. Moddy automates these tasks through the `setup` command and offers other helpers such as self-update.
The `changelog` command can be used to view notes for recent Moddy releases.
