**Dynamic Edge** redefines how you enhance your equipment by introducing **Augments**, unique upgrades earned through gameplay. Each augment reflects how you interact with the world, making your gear feel truly personal.  

### **Augments**  
- **Cake Destroyer** üéÇ: Break cakes to unlock this sweet augment, which occasionally drops sugar.  
- **Oceanic** üåä: Spend time underwater to gain this augment, boosting your swimming speed.  
- **Treehugger** üå≥: Chop down a large number of trees to earn this augment, which occasionally drops extra saplings or apples.  
- **Blazing Edge** üî•: Use a sword or axe while on fire to add fire damage to melee attacks.  
- **Frosty Feet** ‚ùÑÔ∏è: Spend time on snow or ice to prevent slipping and reduce fall damage on snowy surfaces.  
- **Creeperbane** üí•: Survive multiple creeper explosions with a shield to reduce shield damage from explosions.  
- **Glowtouched** ‚ú®: Interact with glow squids to make your tools emit a faint glow, illuminating nearby blocks.  
- **Beekeeper** üêù: Harvest honey safely to slightly boost crop growth when carrying tools with this augment.  
- **Windrunner** üí®: Sprint long distances to increase sprinting speed and reduce hunger drain.  
- **Voidwalker** üåå: Spend time near the void to reduce fall damage and gain a short slow-falling effect.  
- And many MANY more.

With **Dynamic Edge**, your gear evolves alongside your adventures, offering rewards for creativity and exploration.
### How To Use It

Just play the game, you should notice the augments in your gear naturally.

## Beta

The mod is in the early stages of development and your feedback is invaluable. If you have any ideas, requests or comments let me know [here](https://github.com/iamkaf/mod-issues) or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HV5WgTksaB) and shoot me a message. Not to mention this is one of my first mods so I'm learning on the go. :P

### Current Plan

The development plan is to make the mod more customizable and port it to 1.20.1 and 1.21.4+ and beyond. If you have any requests for features or mod compats let me know.

#### Roadmap
