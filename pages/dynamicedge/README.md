# Dynamic Edge

![Dynamic Edge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamkaf/modresources/refs/heads/main/pages/dynamicedge/banner.png)

A new way to upgrade your gear!

Requires [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api).



**Dynamic Edge** redefines how you enhance your equipment by introducing **Augments**, unique upgrades earned through gameplay. Each augment reflects how you interact with the world, making your gear feel truly personal.  

### **Augments**  
- **Cake Destroyer** 🎂: Break cakes to unlock this sweet augment, which occasionally drops sugar.  
- **Oceanic** 🌊: Spend time underwater to gain this augment, boosting your swimming speed.  
- **Treehugger** 🌳: Chop down a large number of trees to earn this augment, which occasionally drops extra saplings or apples.  
- **Blazing Edge** 🔥: Use a sword or axe while on fire to add fire damage to melee attacks.  
- **Frosty Feet** ❄️: Spend time on snow or ice to prevent slipping and reduce fall damage on snowy surfaces.  
- **Creeperbane** 💥: Survive multiple creeper explosions with a shield to reduce shield damage from explosions.  
- **Glowtouched** ✨: Interact with glow squids to make your tools emit a faint glow, illuminating nearby blocks.  
- **Beekeeper** 🐝: Harvest honey safely to slightly boost crop growth when carrying tools with this augment.  
- **Windrunner** 💨: Sprint long distances to increase sprinting speed and reduce hunger drain.  
- **Voidwalker** 🌌: Spend time near the void to reduce fall damage and gain a short slow-falling effect.  
- And many MANY more.

With **Dynamic Edge**, your gear evolves alongside your adventures, offering rewards for creativity and exploration.

## How To Use

Just play the game, you should notice the augments in your gear naturally.
