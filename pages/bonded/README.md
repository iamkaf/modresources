**Bonded** is a gear-focused mod that encourages you to build a deeper connection with your tools and armor as you play.  

- âœ¨ **Level Up Your Gear**: The more you use your tools, weapons, and armor, the stronger they become, gaining bonus stats over time.  
- ðŸªµ **New Stations**: Enhance and maintain your equipment using the new **Tool Bench** and **Repair Bench** introduced by the mod.  
- ðŸŽ® **Progression Through Play**: No complicated systemsâ€”just play the game and let your equipment grow alongside you.  

With **Bonded**, every item you craft becomes a companion on your journey.

The leveling and repairing feature will work with any tool and armor mod out of the box. Upgrade paths, however, will require compat mods that I can make at your request, just hmu.
### How To Use It

Use an item on the **Repair Bench** to repair it, consuming 1 of the repair material for that item.

Use an item on the **Tool Bench** to upgrade it to the next tier. The item must be level 10 (configurable) and you must have the upgrade material in your inventory.

## Beta

The mod is in the early stages of development and your feedback is invaluable. If you have any ideas, requests or comments let me know [here](https://github.com/iamkaf/mod-issues) or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HV5WgTksaB) and shoot me a message. Not to mention this is one of my first mods so I'm learning on the go. :P

### Current Plan

The development plan is to make the mod more customizable and port it to 1.20.1 and 1.21.4+ and beyond. If you have any requests for features or mod compats let me know.

#### Roadmap

- Port to 1.21.4
- Port to 1.20.1

Thank you for the support!
