# Bonded

![Bonded](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamkaf/modresources/refs/heads/main/pages/bonded/banner.png)

A gear leveling mod for Fabric and NeoForge.

Requires [Architectury API](https://modrinth.com/mod/architectury-api) and [Forge Config API Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port).



**Bonded** is a gear-focused mod that encourages you to build a deeper connection with your tools and armor as you play.  

- âœ¨ **Level Up Your Gear**: The more you use your tools, weapons, and armor, the stronger they become, gaining bonus stats over time.  
- ðŸªµ **New Stations**: Enhance and maintain your equipment using the new **Tool Bench** and **Repair Bench** introduced by the mod.  
- ðŸŽ® **Progression Through Play**: No complicated systemsâ€”just play the game and let your equipment grow alongside you.  

With **Bonded**, every item you craft becomes a companion on your journey.

The leveling and repairing feature will work with any tool and armor mod out of the box. Upgrade paths, however, will require compat mods that I can make at your request, just hmu.

## How To Use

Use an item on the **Repair Bench** to repair it, consuming 1 of the repair material for that item.

Use an item on the **Tool Bench** to upgrade it to the next tier. The item must be level 10 (configurable) and you must have the upgrade material in your inventory.
