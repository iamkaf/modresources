### How To Use It

Hold the Tilde/Grave key, look at a block, and mine it. The outlines should show what you're about to mine.

There are a few shapes you can mine with and to switch between them hold the Liteminer key and scroll your mouse wheel.

The available shapes are: Shapeless (mines connected blocks), 3x3, Small Tunnel, Staircase Up and Staircase Down.
