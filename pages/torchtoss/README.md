# Torch Toss

With Torch Toss, you can throw torches ahead of you, lighting up caves, tunnels, and dark paths with ease!

It's works with Redstone Torches too! You can activate redstone circuits by throwing torches in front of them.

Torch Toss is a great addition to any Minecraft server!

## How To Use

Combine two torches on the crafting grid to make the throwable torch. Place it in your hand and right-click to throw it.
