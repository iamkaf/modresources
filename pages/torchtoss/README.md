With Torch Toss, you can throw torches ahead of you, lighting up caves, tunnels, and dark paths with ease!



### How To Use It

Combine two torches on the crafting grid to make the throwable torch. Place it in your hand and right-click to throw it.

### Current Plan

The development plan is to make the mod more customizable and update it to the latest versions of Minecraft. If you have any requests for features or mod compats let me know.
