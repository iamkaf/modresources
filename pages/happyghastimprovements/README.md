A Minecraft mod that makes Happy Ghasts quieter and allows you to boost their speed by feeding them different items.

### Features

**Quieter Happy Ghasts**
Normal ambient sounds occur every 36 seconds instead of 6 seconds (6x quieter). When being ridden, sounds occur every 60 seconds instead of 36 seconds (1.67x quieter).

**Speed Boost System**
Feed Happy Ghasts to give them temporary speed boosts with different power levels:
- **Sugar** gives Speed II for 20 seconds (2x speed boost)
- **Honey** gives Speed III for 20 seconds (2.5x speed boost)
- **Dragon's Breath** gives Speed IV for 20 seconds (3x speed boost)

**Enhanced Riding Experience**
- Increased reach distance of +1 block when riding a Happy Ghast.
- Sound effect plays when speed effect expires to let you know it's time to feed your happy ghast again.

### How To Use It

1. Tame a Happy Ghast (if not already tamed).
2. Feed for speed boost: Right-click the ghast or use the item while riding.
3. Choose your fuel: Sugar (moderate), Honey (fast), Dragon's Breath (fastest).
4. Enjoy enhanced mobility for 20 seconds!
