# Happy Ghast Improvements

A Minecraft mod that makes Happy Ghasts quieter and allows you to boost their speed by feeding them different items.

## Features

**Quieter Happy Ghasts**
Normal ambient sounds occur every 36 seconds instead of 6 seconds. When being ridden, sounds occur every 60 seconds instead of 36 seconds.

**Speed Boost System**
Feed Happy Ghasts to give them temporary speed boosts with different power levels:
- Sugar gives Speed II for 20 seconds (2x speed boost)
- Honey gives Speed III for 20 seconds (2.5x speed boost)
- Dragon's Breath gives Speed IV for 20 seconds (3x speed boost)

**Enhanced Riding Experience**
- Increased reach distance of +1 block when riding a Happy Ghast
- Sound effect plays when speed effect expires to let you know it's time to feed your happy ghast again

**Feeding Methods**
- Ground feeding: Right-click on a Happy Ghast with any feedable item
- Mounted feeding: Use items while riding a Happy Ghast

## Compatibility

- Loaders: Fabric, NeoForge
- Dependencies: Amber

## How to Use

1. Tame a Happy Ghast (if not already tamed)
2. Feed for speed boost: Right-click the ghast or use the item while riding
3. Choose your fuel: Sugar (moderate), Honey (fast), Dragon's Breath (fastest)
4. Enjoy enhanced mobility for 20 seconds
