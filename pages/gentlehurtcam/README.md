# Gentle Hurt Cam

A Minecraft Q&L accessibility mod that cancels the hurt camera effect when you take zero damage. I made this since the vanilla accessibility option to do that doesn't let you cancel the hurt based on damage taken, it's all or nothing.

## Features

**No More Shake for Zero Damage**

When you take damage that's fully absorbed (by armor, enchantments, or other protection), the hurt camera shake effect is cancelled. Your screen won't shake when you don't actually take any damage.

## Compatibility

Let me know if you find any issues!

## How It Works

The mod monitors the hurt camera effect and cancels it when the damage is less than half a heart.

This means when you have full netherite armor or other damage reduction that absorbs all incoming damage, your view stays steady.
