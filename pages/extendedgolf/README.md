### Features:
- 🎯 **Every Mob Gets Its Own Loot**: No more generic drops, each mob has its own unique loot pool! From the Warden to Slimes, each kill brings new rewards.  
- 🛠️ **Customizable Loot**: Want to change the loot? Create your own datapacks to swap out or add new drops. It's all in your hands!

- 🔄 **More Than Just Music Discs**: This isn’t your average skeleton kill, expect everything from rare materials to fun, quirky items!

## How To Use

Position yourself near a mob and wait for the Skeleton to hit and kill it. Once it does, you'll get loot specific to that mob. You can also customize the loot drops by making your own datapacks if you want to tweak things further.
