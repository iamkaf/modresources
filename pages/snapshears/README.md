# SnapShears

![Amber Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamkaf/modresources/refs/heads/main/pages/snapshears/banner.png)

Area-of-effect shearing that trims every adult sheep nearby, server side.

Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and [Amber](https://modrinth.com/mod/amber).

## How To Use

Jump on the sheep and use the shears. Like if you were criting with a sword.

## Images

## Config

In the config `snapshears.json5` you can configure which mods are considered shears.

Add item ids like `minecraft:shears` or prefix a tag with `#` (e.g. `#c:tools/shear`).

## Compatibility

SnapShears calls Minecraftâ€™s built-in shear() method, so any sheep variant that responds to normal shears will work too. If you find any problems, let me know.
