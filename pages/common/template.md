### How To Use It

{{mod_how_to_use}}

## Beta

The mod is in the early stages of development and your feedback is invaluable. If you have any ideas, requests or comments let me know [here](https://github.com/iamkaf/mod-issues) or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HV5WgTksaB) and shoot me a message. Not to mention this is one of my first mods so I'm learning on the go. :P

### Current Plan

The development plan is to make the mod more customizable and port it to 1.20.1 and 1.21.3+ and beyond. If you have any requests for features or mod compats let me know.

#### Roadmap

## Q&A

**Q: Where can I ask something that is not listed here?**

A: Make an issue [here](https://github.com/iamkaf/mod-issues) or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HV5WgTksaB) and shoot me a message.


**Q: Can you port it to [MC version/Mod loader]?**

A: If enough people request it I'll give it some time, but this really is a 1-man team so it might take a while.


**Q: Can I include it in my modpack?**

A: Yes, no need to give credit or ask.

## Compatibility

Let me know if you find any issues (again, beta).
