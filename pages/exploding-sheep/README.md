Baa... **BOOM!** Sheep explode when they eat grass. That's it. That's the whole mod.

### When does this happen?

Whenever a sheep decides it's snack time:
- Munching on tall grass? **Kaboom!**
- Nibbling on grass blocks? **Boom!**
- Eating any grass-related thing? **Bang!**

### Is this useful?

No.

### Is this funny?

Yes.

### How to use

1. Find a sheep.
2. Wait for it to eat grass.
3. Enjoy the fireworks!
