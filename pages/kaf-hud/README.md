### How To Use It

Toggle the HUD with the keybind (default `N`) and copy your coordinates holding shift plus the keybind (default `Shift+N`).


### Current Plan

The development plan is to make the mod more customizable and port it to 1.20.1 and 1.21.4+ and beyond. If you have any requests for features or mod compats let me know.

#### Roadmap

- Port to 1.21.4
- Port to 1.20.1
- Add a config file

Thank you for the support!
