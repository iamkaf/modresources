### How To Use It

Toggle the HUD with the keybind (default N) and copy your coordinates holding shift + the keybind (default Shift+N).

## Beta

The mod is in the early stages of development and your feedback is invaluable. If you have any ideas, requests or comments let me know [here](https://github.com/iamkaf/mod-issues) or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/HV5WgTksaB) and shoot me a message. Not to mention this is one of my first mods so I'm learning on the go. :P

### Current Plan

The development plan is to make the mod more customizable and port it to 1.20.1 and 1.21.4+ and beyond. If you have any requests for features or mod compats let me know.

#### Roadmap

- Port to 1.21.4
- Port to 1.20.1
- Add a config file

Thank you for the support!
